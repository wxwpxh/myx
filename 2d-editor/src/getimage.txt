       The _X_P_u_t_I_m_a_g_e function combines an image with a rectangle
       of the specified drawable.  The section of the image
       defined by the src_x, src_y, width, and height arguments
       is drawn on the specified part of the drawable.  If
       _X_Y_B_i_t_m_a_p format is used, the depth of the image must be
       one, or a _B_a_d_M_a_t_c_h error results.  The foreground pixel in
       the GC defines the source for the one bits in the image,
       and the background pixel defines the source for the zero
       bits.  For _X_Y_P_i_x_m_a_p and _Z_P_i_x_m_a_p, the depth of the image
       must match the depth of the drawable, or a _B_a_d_M_a_t_c_h error
       results.

       If the characteristics of the image (for example,
       byte_order and bitmap_unit) differ from what the server
       requires, _X_P_u_t_I_m_a_g_e automatically makes the appropriate
       conversions.

       This function uses these GC components: function, plane-
       mask, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and
       clip-mask.  It also uses these GC mode-dependent compo­
       nents: foreground and background.

       _X_P_u_t_I_m_a_g_e can generate _B_a_d_D_r_a_w_a_b_l_e, _B_a_d_G_C, _B_a_d_M_a_t_c_h, and
       _B_a_d_V_a_l_u_e errors.

       The _X_G_e_t_I_m_a_g_e function returns a pointer to an _X_I_m_a_g_e
       structure.  This structure provides you with the contents
       of the specified rectangle of the drawable in the format
       you specify.  If the format argument is _X_Y_P_i_x_m_a_p, the
       image contains only the bit planes you passed to the

       plane_mask argument.  If the plane_mask argument only
       requests a subset of the planes of the display, the depth
       of the returned image will be the number of planes
       requested.  If the format argument is _Z_P_i_x_m_a_p, _X_G_e_t_I_m_a_g_e
       returns as zero the bits in all planes not specified in
       the plane_mask argument.  The function performs no range
       checking on the values in plane_mask and ignores extrane­
       ous bits.

       _X_G_e_t_I_m_a_g_e returns the depth of the image to the depth mem­
       ber of the _X_I_m_a_g_e structure.  The depth of the image is as
       specified when the drawable was created, except when get­
       ting a subset of the planes in _X_Y_P_i_x_m_a_p format, when the
       depth is given by the number of bits set to 1 in
       plane_mask.

       If the drawable is a pixmap, the given rectangle must be
       wholly contained within the pixmap, or a _B_a_d_M_a_t_c_h error
       results.  If the drawable is a window, the window must be
       viewable, and it must be the case that if there were no
       inferiors or overlapping windows, the specified rectangle
       of the window would be fully visible on the screen and
       wholly contained within the outside edges of the window,
       or a _B_a_d_M_a_t_c_h error results.  Note that the borders of the
       window can be included and read with this request.  If the
       window has backing-store, the backing-store contents are
       returned for regions of the window that are obscured by
       noninferior windows.  If the window does not have backing-
       store, the returned contents of such obscured regions are
       undefined.  The returned contents of visible regions of
       inferiors of a different depth than the specified window's
       depth are also undefined.  The pointer cursor image is not
       included in the returned contents.  If a problem occurs,
       _X_G_e_t_I_m_a_g_e returns NULL.

       _X_G_e_t_I_m_a_g_e can generate _B_a_d_D_r_a_w_a_b_l_e, _B_a_d_M_a_t_c_h, and _B_a_d_V_a_l_u_e
       errors.

       The _X_G_e_t_S_u_b_I_m_a_g_e function updates dest_image with the
       specified subimage in the same manner as _X_G_e_t_I_m_a_g_e.  If
       the format argument is _X_Y_P_i_x_m_a_p, the image contains only
       the bit planes you passed to the plane_mask argument.  If
       the format argument is _Z_P_i_x_m_a_p, _X_G_e_t_S_u_b_I_m_a_g_e returns as
       zero the bits in all planes not specified in the
       plane_mask argument.  The function performs no range
       checking on the values in plane_mask and ignores extrane­
       ous bits.  As a convenience, _X_G_e_t_S_u_b_I_m_a_g_e returns a
       pointer to the same _X_I_m_a_g_e structure specified by
       dest_image.

       The depth of the destination _X_I_m_a_g_e structure must be the
       same as that of the drawable.  If the specified subimage
       does not fit at the specified location on the destination
       image, the right and bottom edges are clipped.  If the

       contained within the pixmap, or a _B_a_d_M_a_t_c_h error results.
       If the drawable is a window, the window must be viewable,

       within the outside edges of the window, or a _B_a_d_M_a_t_c_h
       error results.  If the window has backing-store, then the
       backing-store contents are returned for regions of the
       window that are obscured by noninferior windows.  If the
       window does not have backing-store, the returned contents
       of such obscured regions are undefined.  The returned con­
       tents of visible regions of inferiors of a different depth
       than the specified window's depth are also undefined.  If
       a problem occurs, _X_G_e_t_S_u_b_I_m_a_g_e returns NULL.

       _X_G_e_t_S_u_b_I_m_a_g_e can generate _B_a_d_D_r_a_w_a_b_l_e, _B_a_d_G_C, _B_a_d_M_a_t_c_h,
